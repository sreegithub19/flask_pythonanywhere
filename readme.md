We're happy to host your free website -- and keep it free -- for as long as you want to keep it running, but you'll need to log in at least once every three months and click the "Run until 3 months from today" button below. We'll send you an email a week before the site is disabled so that you don't forget to do that. See here for more details.

Paying users' sites stay up forever without any need to log in to keep them running.
